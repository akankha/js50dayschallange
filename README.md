# 50 Projects 50 Days

This is a repository for my "50 Projects 50 Days" challenge, inspired by Traversy Media. In this challenge, I will be completing 50 small projects using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in 50 days or less. Each project will have its own folder, containing the project files and a README.md file with a description of the project.

## Projects

Here are the 50 small projects I will be completing as part of this challenge:

## Getting Started

To view the projects, simply browse the folders in the repository. Each project folder will contain its own README.md file with a description of the project and instructions on how to run the code.

## Prerequisites

To run the projects, you should have a basic understanding of programming concepts and a code editor installed on your machine, such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.
